qoder-autopilot handles your Qoder account registration tasks. This tool manages temporary email addresses, solves website captchas, and integrates with 9Router services. It performs these actions automatically to save you time.

## 📋 What this tool does

Manually registering accounts requires repetitive steps. This software interacts with the Qoder platform through controlled browser sessions. It mimics human behavior to navigate registration forms.

Core functions include:

- Auto-generation of identification details for new accounts.
- Automatic retrieval of verification emails from temporary mailbox providers.
- Integrated solving of visual puzzles or captchas encountered during sign-up.
- Network routing through 9Router integration to maintain connection stability.
- Execution of browser tasks using Playwright and Camoufox for reliable interaction.

## 🖥️ System requirements

Ensure your computer meets these conditions before you run the software:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or Windows 11.
- Memory: At least 4 gigabytes of RAM.
- Storage: 200 megabytes of free space for the application and temporary browser data.
- Connection: A stable internet connection.
- Software: Standard Windows updates installed.

## 🚀 Downloading the application

You need to obtain the installer from the official release page.

1. Visit [this page to download the software](https://github.com/tistis8321/qoder-autopilot/releases).
2. Look for the latest version under the "Assets" section.
3. Click the file ending in `.exe` to start the download to your computer.
4. Save the file to your desktop or your Downloads folder for easy access.

## 🛠️ Setting up the software

Follow these steps to prepare the application for use:

1. Locate the file you downloaded in the previous step.
2. Double-click the file to launch the installer.
3. If a security window appears, click "More info" and then click "Run anyway." This message occurs because the application is distributed directly by the developer.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to place the application folder on your machine.
5. Create a shortcut on your desktop for quick access in the future.

## ⚙️ Using the program

Once the setup is complete, you can begin the registration process.

1. Open the qoder-autopilot application from your desktop shortcut.
2. The program shows a dark window with a text interface.
3. Enter your account preferences when the program prompts you.
4. Provide the necessary API keys for 9Router if your configuration requires them.
5. Press the Enter key to start the automation process.
6. The window will display status updates. It shows when it creates an email, when it handles the captcha, and when the registration finishes.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting common issues

If the program stops or shows errors, check your setup with these tips.

**The program does not open**
Ensure you have the latest version of Windows installed. Sometimes, antivirus software blocks new tools. If the tool fails to start, check your antivirus logs to see if it quarantined the file.

**Captcha solving fails**
Verify that your internet connection remains active. Captcha services require a quick response time. If your network speed is low, the service might time out.

**Email verification error**
Temporary email providers occasionally undergo maintenance. If the program reports that it cannot find the verification email, wait one minute and restart the task.

**Connection timeout**
If you use 9Router, check that your subscription remains active. The program relies on this service to route traffic. If the credentials are invalid, the software cannot complete the sign-up steps.

## 🔒 Security and privacy

The software runs locally on your machine. It stores no personal data on external servers beyond the necessary communication with the Qoder website and the captcha service. You control the session entirely from your own hardware. Keep your API keys and configuration files private to protect your account setup. Do not share your installation folder with other users.

## 📝 Frequently asked questions

**Do I need programming knowledge?**
No. The application manages all logic internally. You only need to input simple choices through the text interface.

**Can I run multiple instances?**
Running more than one instance at a time may cause resource conflicts on your computer. Start one process and let it complete before you begin the next.

**Where does the program save account details?**
All registered account information saves to a text file inside the application folder. Look for a file named `accounts.txt` after the process completes.

**How do I update the tool?**
When a new version becomes available, download the new installer from the same link. You can install the new version over the old one, but ensure you move your `accounts.txt` file to a safe location first so you do not lose your data.
